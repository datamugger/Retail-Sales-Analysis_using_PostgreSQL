-- That's why many people use pandas for this df.isnull().sum()

-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05

Select * from retail_sales;

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05'; -- 11 rows


-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and 
--     the quantity sold is more or equal to 4 in the month of Nov-2022

Select * from retail_sales;
select month('2022-11-22');
select extract(month from '2022-11-22'::date);
select DATE_PART(month, '2022-11-22');

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
AND quantity >= 4
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) = 11
AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2022;


SELECT 
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4;


-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS Total_Sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;


-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(age),2) AS Avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';


-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;


-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made 
--    by each gender in each category.

SELECT category, gender, COUNT(transaction_id) AS Transaction_count
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY 1;


-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. 
--     Find out best selling month in each year

-- average sale for each month of the year
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date),
	DATE_PART('month', sale_date),
	AVG(total_sale)
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date), DATE_PART('month', sale_date)

) as t1
WHERE rank = 1



-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 

Select * from retail_sales;

FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

Select * from retail_sales;

SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS Unique_customer
FROM retail_sales

-- Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders 
--     (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)

Select * from retail_sales;

WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT transaction_id,sale_time,
		CASE
			WHEN sale_time <= '12:00:00' THEN 'Morning'
			WHEN sale_time > '12:00:00' AND sale_time <= '17:00:00' THEN 'Afternoon'
			ELSE 'Evening'
		END AS Shift
	FROM retail_sales

SELECT

-- correct answer
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
